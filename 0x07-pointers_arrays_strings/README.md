# C Programming Project Summary

## Objective
The objective of this C programming project is to reinforce knowledge of pointers, arrays, and strings. You will be tasked with completing various programming tasks to meet specific learning objectives.

## Project Requirements
- **Allowed Editors:** You can use editors like vi, vim, or emacs for coding.
- **Compilation:** The code will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with specific options.
- **Coding Style:** Follow the "Betty" coding style, which includes style checks for code and documentation.
- **Global Variables:** Avoid using global variables in your code.
- **Function Limit:** Each source code file should contain no more than 5 functions.
- **Standard Library:** You are not allowed to use standard library functions (e.g., `printf`, `puts`) except for `_putchar`.
- **Header File:** Create a `main.h` header file that contains function prototypes and the `_putchar` function.

## Learning Objectives
The project aims to reinforce knowledge of:
- Pointers to pointers (double pointers)
- Multidimensional arrays in C
- Common C standard library functions for string manipulation

## Additional Notes
You do not need to learn about pointers to functions, arrays of structures, `malloc`, and `free` for this project.
