## Introduction
This project is focused on understanding and implementing recursion in the C programming language. Recursion is a powerful technique where a function calls itself to solve problems, often breaking complex problems into simpler subproblems.

The project covers topics such as what recursion is, how to implement it, and when it is suitable to use recursion in your programs. It also discusses situations where recursion should be avoided.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without external assistance:
- What recursion is
- How to implement recursion in C
- When it's appropriate to use recursion
- When it's not suitable to use recursion

## Requirements
### General
- Editors allowed: vi, vim, emacs
- Compilation on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All source code files should end with a newline
- A README.md file in the project's root directory is mandatory
- Code must adhere to the Betty coding style (checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl)
- No use of global variables
- Each source code file can contain no more than 5 functions
- Prohibited use of standard library functions like printf, puts, etc.
- Allowed to use the `_putchar` function
- Do not push `_putchar.c`; it will not be considered
- Prototypes of functions, including `_putchar`, should be included in a header file named `main.h`
- Don't forget to push your header file
- Loops are not allowed
- Static variables are not allowed
