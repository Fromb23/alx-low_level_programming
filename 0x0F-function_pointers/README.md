# Function Pointers in C - Learning Project

## Overview
This learning project aims to help you understand the concept of function pointers in C and how to use them. You will explore what function pointers hold and where they point to in virtual memory.

## Resources
Before diving into the project, make sure to read or watch the following resources:
- [Function Pointer in C](https://example.com/function-pointer-c)
- [Pointers to Functions](https://example.com/pointers-to-functions)
- [Function Pointers in C / C++](https://example.com/function-pointers-c-cpp)
- [Why Pointers to Functions?](https://example.com/why-pointers-to-functions)
- [Everything you need to know about pointers in C](https://example.com/pointers-in-c)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without external help:

### General
1. What are function pointers and how to use them.
2. What exactly a function pointer holds.
3. Where a function pointer points to in virtual memory.

## Requirements
To successfully complete this project, adhere to the following requirements:

### General
- Use text editors such as vi, vim, or emacs.
- Compile your code on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- Ensure that all your files end with a newline character.
- Create a `README.md` file at the root of your project folder.
- Follow the Betty style for your code, and check it using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- Avoid using global variables.
- Limit the number of functions in each file to no more than 5.
- Only use the C standard library functions `malloc`, `free`, and `exit`. Avoid functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc`, etc.
- You are allowed to use `_putchar`.
- You don't need to include the `_putchar.c` file in your repository; we will provide our own.
- Ensure that the prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` are included in a header file named `function_pointers.h`.
- Use include guards in all your header files.
