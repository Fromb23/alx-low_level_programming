# Project Title: C - Function Pointers

## Resources

Read or watch the following resources to understand function pointers in C:

- [Function Pointer in C](resource_link)
- [Pointers to functions](resource_link)
- [Function Pointers in C / C++](resource_link)
- [Why Pointers to Functions?](resource_link)
- [Everything You Need to Know About Pointers in C](resource_link)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General

1. What are function pointers and how to use them.
2. What does a function pointer exactly hold.
3. Where does a function pointer point to in the virtual memory.

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, with the following options: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- All your files should end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
- Your code should use the Betty style, which will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- You are not allowed to use global variables.
- No more than 5 functions per file.
- The only C standard library functions allowed are `malloc`, `free`, and `exit`. The use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc`, etc., is forbidden.
- You are allowed to use `_putchar`.
- You don't have to push `_putchar.c`. We will use our file. If you do, it won't be taken into account.
- In the following examples, the `main.c` files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don't have to push them to your repo. We will use our own `main.c` files at compilation. Our `main.c` files might be different from the one shown in the examples.
- The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `function_pointers.h`.
- Don't forget to push your header file.
- All your header files should be include guarded.
