## Requirements

### General
- **Allowed Editors**: vi, vim, emacs
- **Compilation**: All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- **File Ending**: All your files should end with a new line
- **README**: A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- **Coding Style**: Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- **Global Variables**: You are not allowed to use global variables
- **Functions**: No more than 5 functions per file
- **Standard Library Functions**: The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free, and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc, etc… is forbidden
- **_putchar**: You are allowed to use _putchar. You don’t have to push _putchar.c; we will use our file. If you do, it won’t be taken into account
- **Main Files**: In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo. We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the ones shown in the examples.
- **Header Files**: Don’t forget to push your header file. All your header files should be include guarded
