# C - More malloc, free

In this C programming project, you are expected to work with dynamic memory allocation using `malloc`, `free`, `calloc`, and `realloc`. You will also learn about using the `exit` function. This project aims to help you understand memory management and the proper usage of these functions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

1. How to use the `exit` function.
2. What the functions `calloc` and `realloc` from the standard library are and how to use them.

## General Requirements

- You should use the following editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, with the following options: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- Ensure that all your files end with a new line.
- You must provide a `README.md` file at the root of the project folder.
- Your code should adhere to the Betty style, which will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- Avoid the use of global variables.
- Each source file should contain no more than 5 functions.
- The only C standard library functions allowed are `malloc`, `free`, and `exit`. Do not use functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc`, etc.
- You are allowed to use the `_putchar` function.
- You don't need to push `_putchar.c`; the evaluator will use their file.
- Include the prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the `_putchar` function in your header file called `main.h`.

## Tasks

You are expected to implement solutions for the tasks in this project, focusing on using dynamic memory allocation, `exit`, `calloc`, and `realloc`. Ensure that you do not plagiarize any code or content.

The specifics of the tasks and the code implementation are not provided here but can be found in your project description.

Remember that understanding and adhering to the guidelines and objectives mentioned in this project will help you become proficient in managing memory and using these essential C functions. Good luck with your project!
