# Project 0x0B - C - malloc, free

## General Information

This project focuses on dynamic memory allocation in C, specifically using `malloc` and `free` functions. You will learn about the differences between automatic and dynamic allocation, how to use `malloc` and `free`, when and why to use `malloc`, and how to check for memory leaks using Valgrind.

## Requirements

- **Allowed Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Compilation:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All source code files should end with a newline character.
- A `README.md` file must be present at the root of the project folder.
- Code should follow the Betty style, and it will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- Avoid using global variables.
- Each source file should contain no more than 5 functions.
- Only the C standard library functions `malloc` and `free` are allowed. Avoid using other functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc`, etc.
- You can use the provided `_putchar` function, and you don't need to push `_putchar.c`.
- Header file `main.h` should contain the prototypes for all your functions, including `_putchar`.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

1. Explain the difference between automatic and dynamic allocation.
2. Understand what `malloc` and `free` are and how to use them.
3. Know when and why to use `malloc`.
4. Use Valgrind to check for memory leaks.

## Project Tasks

1. Write a function that creates an array of integers.
2. Write a function that concatenates two strings.
3. Write a program that multiplies two positive numbers.
4. Write a function that allocates memory for an array, using `malloc`.
5. Write a function that creates an array of integers and initializes it with a specific value.
6. Write a program that reallocates memory for an array, using `malloc` and `free`.
7. Write a function that concatenates all the arguments of your program.
8. Write a program that duplicates a string.
9. Write a function that splits a string into words.

## Project Structure

The project should have the following structure:
